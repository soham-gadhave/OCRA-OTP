**How to run:** It is mandatory that you run first the ```server.py``` file and then run ```client.py``` in another terminal. If there's some problem with the database then try uncommenting
the code from the line number 31 to 36 both inclusive in ```server.py``` and just run the server.py file. Now comment the code again and run as usual.
